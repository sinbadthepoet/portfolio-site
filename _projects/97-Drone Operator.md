Ubisoft NEXT is an annual competition held by Ubisoft Toronto challenging Game Dev Students and recent graduates to create something for a chance at an internship. In **2023**, Ubisoft featured a **Game Design** category, asking participants to create a **new enemy archetype for a Far Cry game**. My entries to the competition earned me a semi-finalist position, and it was a great experience all around. Below I've attached my entries for the competition, including my high level pitch, and my detailed design document! For the pitch, I experimented with using AI for my visuals to help keep it engaging, but it's not something I plan on doing again!
