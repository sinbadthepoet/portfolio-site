I've participated in at least 6 Game Jams throughout the years, including Ontario Tech University's GDJam, Global Game Jam, and the GMTK Game Jam. They're fun experiences and I often use them to teach new developers about game development as an entry point, mentoring them in the process. They're often not the best in truth, but you can find a few of them on my itch.io page!
