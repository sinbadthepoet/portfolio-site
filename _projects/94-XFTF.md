The X-Frame Task Force is a cooperative comedy-horror shooter inspired by Patlabor The Movie, and games like Lethal Company, GTFO, and We Were Here. In the game, players are tasked with infiltrating a procedurally generated facility that is patrolled by robots gone rogue, including a number of scary "Cyber-Ghosts" (working name). Players will need to manage their limited resources while exploring the facility together, completing objectives within the environment gain access to "the core", from where they can destroy the facility.

It's important to note that XFTF is a game that is planning to be built in stages. As milestones of the game are hit, the scope of the project will be reevaluated, and new element may be introduced as they're deemed viable. The details outlined here will represent a hopeful view for the game, where it might be fully featured. However, the early development of the project will be focused on the foundations of [BALISSET](/projects/95-BALISSET.html), and focusing on the fundamental mechanics of the game.

The core gameplay of XFTF is similar to Lethal Company. Players explore a procedurally generated environment in search of objectives required to reach an end goal. Communication is diagetic, and players are encouraged to split up in order to complete their mission in time. This creates uncertainty in the information players have, as they might not know if a player sent to power junction to open a door has their radio jammed, it's power run out, or it's operator dead. Comedy is an essential aspect to making this horror enjoyable, clippable, and something players will want to share online, so it's something the game will emphasize.

Eventually, I would love to add additional phases to the game, such as a final showdown power fantasy once players reach the core and begin an involved self destruct sequence, a bombastic opening which determines what equipment the players start the exploration phase with, creating a series of "sectors" for players to complete, each connected to a central outpost location with a terminal one player can use as an alternative way to support their team, and hopefully mech suits (X-Frames!) that come with massive advantages but are limited in how they can navigate an environment, requiring alternative pathways, the use of limited resources, or additional time.
