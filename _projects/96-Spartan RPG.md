In 2024, I took a course on tabletop roleplaying games, and one of the assignments was to create a tabletop system. One of my favourite franchises is Halo, so I chose to adapt it's gameplay and lore into a tabletop system. The focus here was primarily on combat, adapting the diverse weapons sandbox, environmental interactions, and unique combat flow of Halo into a fun tabletop experience. However, I also wanted players to consider the implications of their existance as a Spartan in the world, and use it to create interesting characters.

In a system where everyone is at an Apex beyond the peak of human potential, many common mechanics can't be reused from other systems. Instead, I made an effort to adapt them in a new way. A traditional class system was replaced with a role system which offered bonuses to certain playstyles. Similarly, Spartan's don't easily miss their shots, and so a system was created to track the damage of individual hits. Of course, Spartans rely on their luck to pull off outrageous feats, so luck was turned into a mechanic.

This system was never playtested, so many values may be completely unbalanced. However, the intention is communicated by the one pager and it's accompanying asset sheet.
