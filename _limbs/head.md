Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! I'm a **Game Designer** with a fiery passion for immersive sims, emergent narrative, and systemic game design! I've been developing games since 2020, though I've been thinking about game design for much longer! I graduated from Ontario Tech University's **Game Development and Entrepreneurship Program** in 2024.

I built this website from scratch because I didn’t want to create a standard “bento-box” website but rather something that showcases a little more personality. I think modern design can often be boring, too restrictive, stagnant, and afraid to create something unique that allows users to explore and discover freely. This website was my response. It’s not perfect, but I’m also not a web developer - I learned everything I needed for this project in about a month of on-and-off development! Learning new tools is always a fun challenge.

### GAME DEVELOPMENT

I focus on creating narrative through gameplay. Video games offer a unique method of storytelling that puts players in the driver’s seat. Through their choices and actions, each player should walk away with an experience that reflects who they are and how they play. This philosophy is at the core of all my game design. I hope to bring emergent gameplay and narrative, reactive and responsive mechanics, and player expression to all the games I work on.

**I have experience working with all kinds of tools and software, including:**
- Unreal Engine (C++/Blueprint)
- Unity
- Obsidian/Confluence
- C, C++, C#, Python
- Blender (for creating Diagrams)
- Excel

### EDUCATION AND ACHIEVEMENTS

I studied **Game Development and Entrepreneurship** at **Ontario Tech University** in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada. The Game Development program allowed me to grow with like-minded students, and I highly recommend it for self-motivated individuals. It has a fantastic community, and I made a ton of friends.

While at Ontario Tech, I spent 2 years on the **Game Development Student Association (GDSA)**, leading the team as **President for the 2023-2024 academic year**. The GDSA provides students with new opportunities for growth outside of the classroom. We did that by bringing in guests from the games industry as guest speakers (including devs from Certain Affinity, Arkane, Epic Games, and Ubisoft), hosting game jams to help improve their portfolio, offering workshops where students can improve their craft, and giving them a stage to show off their projects to the Canadian game development industry with <a href="https://gamecon.ca/" target="_blank">GameCon</a>, an annual event to showcase student games.

I led a successful year of substantial growth for the GDSA, beating our performance compared to each prior year. At our faculty’s end-of-year gala, the GDSA won the **Student Association of the Year**, where I also earned the **Student Leader of the Year** award.

### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

While at Ontario Tech, I took as many opportunities for real-world experience as I could. On top of leading the GDSA, I worked with professors on research whenever possible. My projects include:

- Working with the Canadian National Institute for the Blind and OCAD University to design and create user interfaces for those with limited vision.

- Writing tutorial content for students to learn Unreal Engine 5 as the university brought the engine into its curriculum.

- Researching, testing, and modifying cutting-edge 3D reconstructive techniques, including Gaussian splatting. Using this tech, I also developed a workflow to generate and playback volumetric video.

### PERSONAL INTERESTS

Beyond games, I enjoy creative writing, reading, 3D printing, learning to draw (hopefully soon, this will just say drawing!), and improving my programming! My full-time project includes an independent game called [X-Frame Task Force](/projects/94-XFTF.html), a mix of Lethal Company and GTFO, and [BALISSET](/projects/95-BALISSET.html), an Immersive Sim Framework, and the technical foundation I plan to build XFTF on top of. BALISSET will include the basic building blocks I would need for any of my first-person game projects and tools that would allow me to develop future projects even faster. The plan is to publish BALISSET on the Unity Asset Store and eventually open-source it!

Some of my favourite games:

- Baldur's Gate 3
- Divinity: Original Sin II
- XCOM 2
- Deus Ex (2000)
- Boneworks
- Fallout: New Vegas
- Every Halo game ever
