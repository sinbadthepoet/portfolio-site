I have been programming since 2018, with confident experience in Python, C, C++ and C#. I've always been quick to pick up new skills, and honestly find it a fun challenge. During my time as a research assistant, I worked to build internal tools and read research papers to understand and modify the functionality of existing projects. Since graduating, I've spent a little bit of time to learn web development and I have some exciting ideas for projects that I hope to add to this portfolio in the near future!

I'm a designer first, so I would hesitate to call myself an expert programmer. However, I understand that strong technical design skills are essential to ensure that building a project is a smooth process, and so I'm always working to improve my technical abilities. My philosophy with any kind of tech is to understand how it functions at a deep level so that I can ensure I am taking maximum advantage of it's functionality. That means I'll dive into documentation, take extensive notes, and share my work for feedback from those more experienced than me.

With my current focus on [BALISSET](/projects/95-BALISSET.html), I've been improving both my programming skills and my technical design skills, so definitely check out that project if you would like to learn more!
