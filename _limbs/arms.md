Narrative Design is something that is new to me, and something I am currently exploring as a hobby, but hope to learn more about so I can engage with narrative designers on a team more easily.

### THE PITCH

Currently, I am working on fantasy setting inspired by South Asia and the Middle East. As a Pakistani Muslim, I find little representation of my culture in fantasy or science fiction, and even when we get something like the Dune films, our representation is erased. I decided that if someone is going to represent my culture, why shouldn't it be myself?

The world does not yet have a name, but our campaign will take place within the region of Qaleen, an archipelago filled with diverse tribes, cultures, and rich with trade.

The first campaign in the setting will follow a group of immigrants on their way to Machliabad, the capital of the crumbling empire stretched thin as a new foreign empire seeks to expand it's borders. Players will experience a story that touches on the topics of racism, colonializm, slavery, rebellion, and the consequences of war on a civilian population. Also players will get their own boat, because every game needs a mobile base of operations. 

This is a large scope campaign, and will certainly take a long time to every playthrough if I happen to find the group for it, but really this is more an exercise in my own writing and creativity, and an excuse to learn more about my own history. 

### OBJECTIVES

I want to create a story that confronts players with serious themes, asking them what lengths they are willing to go in the pursuit of their objectives and confronting them with the consequences of their actions. The goal is to learn how to make compelling moral conundrums, while integrating them into exciting mission objectives. While the topics can seem heavy, we do want to make sure everyone is having fun.
