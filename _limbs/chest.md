When I watch movies, I often find characters to be in exciting circumstances that have me asking "How would I handle this situation if I was put in the shoes of our character?". If I was John Wick, how would I use my environment to face the overwhelming number of mercenaries at my neck? If I was in Mad Max, how would me and my friends defend the War Rig as it gets attacked by raiders? Better yet, how would me and my friends raid the war rig for ourselves?

I often find these questions get my mind racing at the possibilites of gameplay experiences, as ways of delivering these fantasies in a way no other medium can. Of course, to make these experiences truly authentic, we can't simply make basic interactions. The film characters are using every tool available to them in their world to fight for their survival. That is why players need to play games in a realistically simulated world, full of exciting possibilities that challenge their creativity.

### STORYTELLING

I realized I wanted to become a game designer when I first played **XCOM: Enemy Unknown**. It was the game that really demonstrated the potential of games to not just tell stories, but to create them. It helped me realized how many amazing stories players get to experience when they play through dynamic worlds, where to get to make split second decisions and face their consequences, leading them to victory or defeat. 

This focus on giving our players the tools to create stories is core to every decision I make with my game design. From singleplayer to multiplayer, I like to focus on creating sandboxes that are dynamic, using physics and chemistry to simulate interactions and reward players for considering every option available to them with a unique story they can share with their friends.

I have so many personal anecdotes I could share. Attaching a stun mine to a glass bottle in **Dishonored 2** to create an enemy attracting stun grenade, using the teleportation gloves of **Divinity: Original Sin 2** to break an elf out of jail using stealth when combat proved too difficult. These "a-ha" moments help games go viral, and prove that players want to be rewarded for thinking outside the box, and not told that they're not allowed.

Once players are given a bevy of tools to play with, we need to create challenges that compell them to find a solution. In some ways, every game is a puzzle game, so how can out level designers tweak the parameters to force our players to think outside the box, and find interesting solutions? As game designers, it's our job to create systems and mechanics that facilitate this level of depth.
